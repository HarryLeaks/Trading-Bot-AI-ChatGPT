The best and most advanced type of neural network that can replace the feedforward neural network used in the code above would depend on the specific problem and the dataset being used.

One popular and powerful type of neural network is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). LSTMs are particularly well-suited for time-series data and sequential data, such as financial time-series data, because they are able to remember past information and make predictions based on that information. They can also handle missing or corrupted data, which is common in financial data.

Another type of neural network that can be used for time-series prediction is the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network, which is similar to LSTMs but with fewer parameters, which makes them faster to train and less prone to overfitting.

Another type of neural network that's often used for financial time series prediction is the Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (AttRNN), which uses attention mechanisms to selectively focus on certain parts of the input sequence, which allows the network to capture important features of the data.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are also a powerful type of neural network that can be used for image and signal processing tasks, including time-series data. They are particularly well-suited for tasks such as pattern recognition and feature extraction, which is often required in financial data.

The best type of neural network to use in a specific case will depend on the dataset, the problem, and the performance requirements. It is important to evaluate the performance of different architectures and parameters and choose the one that works best. It is also important to have a robust evaluation metric and a strong understanding of the underlying problem and data to select the best neural network architecture for the task.

-------------------- CODE RESUME ----------------------
In this case, the RNN uses two LSTM layers, with 32 and 16 neurons respectively. The input data is reshaped to 3D format, where the first dimension corresponds to the number of samples, the second dimension corresponds to the number of time steps and the third dimension corresponds to the number of features. This architecture is suitable for time series data where the previous time steps can influence the next time step's output.
