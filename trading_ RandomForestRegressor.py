This is a simple example of how you might go about building a trading bot for Binance futures that uses machine learning and neural networks to predict prices and make decisions, also using indicators such as MACD, RSI, CCI, DX and MMA in Python.

Data collection: Use a library such as ccxt to collect historical market data from Binance in Python. You can also use other libraries such as pandas and numpy to manipulate and preprocess the data.

Data preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for training machine learning models. This may include normalizing the data, removing outliers, and dealing with missing values.

Indicator computation: Use libraries such as ta to compute the indicators such as MACD, RSI, CCI, DX and MMA.

Model selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning model for your use case. Some popular models for time series prediction in Python include Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks, and LSTM. You can use libraries such as scikit-learn, keras, tensorflow to implement these models.

Model training: Train the selected machine learning model on the preprocessed data using libraries such as scikit-learn, `
